# TerrariaTrainerMenu
This trainer was made by Cheat Engine and recieves support and updates including new mods and stuff like that

To open it when ur in the game, just run the .exe and u can either alt tab to it or press Shift+V which should focus it

ALSO RUN IT AS ADMINISTRATOR SO IT CAN MODIFY THE GAME'S MEMORY

If you find any bugs or things not working expected, or even something you would like to see in the menu please tell me lol
